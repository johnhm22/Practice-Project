## Python Practice Project  
A small Python project aimed at practising coding skills and getting back into the swing of Python after sometime living in the JavaScript world.  

It is part of a course from Dave Gray called "Python Full Course for Beginners | Complete All-in-One Tutorial | 9 Hours"

Dave is an impressive tutor in various coding languages and I recommend him.  

#### Using this project
Clone the repository by copying the https link and then, in the terminal, type "git clone [https repo url]".  
Once downloaded, again in the terminal, run "pip install -r requirements.txt". This will install all the necessary third party packages to run the project. It is the equivalent to "npm install" in JavaScript.  

#### Prerequisites  
Python, pip and git are installed in your working directory.  
Also, create a virtual environment in which to work.

#### Running the project  
In the terminal, navigate to the root of the project, and execute the command "python3 server.py" if running Linux or macOS. In Windows run the command "py server.py"
